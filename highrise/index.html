          <h3>Why I Want to Work in Customer Support</h3>
          <p>
            As someone who began a career in the tech sector with a humanities background, I would not be so in-tune with my technical self had it not been for the wonderful people who were willing and excited to teach me a thing or two. I wouldn't be here without the help I received along the way, and I want to pay it forward. The reason I was so drawn to this wonderful world of development was because of all the passion I saw in others while they were creating helpful products. And in a time when technology is advancing so quickly, there will be a lot of those who need assistance in keeping up, and I understand that. I want to work in customer support because I want to be there for others -- be their rock -- when things get complicating. But, I also want to take that one step further by bringing back the feeling of being treated like an individual when asking for help online; the internet has given us the gift of mass communication, but at the same time, it's turned anonymity into the new normal, and with that, when receiving customer service, it's easy to feel like a number rather than a person.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Highrise and Not Somewhere Else</h3>
          <p>
            That brings me to why I want to work at Highrise versus any other company. You guys get it -- I mean, c'mon, your whole product is based around making relations personal again (I almost said "great again," but I didn't want to "Trump up" this sentence)! Reading the reason why you work on Highrise truly resonated with me, and I personally believe that when someone has a personal connection with what they're creating and the mission behind it, it just makes for an even better product than anyone could have imagined. Sure, other companies claim the same, that they want their customer support to be different, but when I read the "why" behind your product I believed it, the words felt genuine. And that's the impression I get with Highrise, that you're genuine people who sincerely want to make a difference. So why do I want to work at Highrise? Because we have the same goal: re-introducing sincere and meaningful interactions and relationships with others, because the real value of any company comes from its delighted customers.

          <h3>A Wonderful Recent Customer Support Experience</h3>
          <p>
            Usually I have to think rather hard about this, but this time around, there's an occasion that stands out. I recently changed gyms, from 24 Hour Fitness to Crunch Gym, mainly because of a customer service issue. I signed up for three months of personal training, and at Crunch the personal training contract is specific to a location, but after a few sessions, I needed to switch locations. At the time, there was no protocol in place for transferring training sessions between locations, but the manager at the Diamond Bar location did something fantastic: he pioneered the process for transferring sessions just to accommodate myself and my husband. And the cherry on top was that throughout the entire process, I was treated like a friend and not a number; helping me was not a burden but a chance to create a standard that could later help others in my situation.
