                Could you imagine me as your brand new intern? Because I certainly can!
                Maybe it's because I'm an INTP, and I've a rich inner world...but I digress.
                I should really give you a reason for giving me a chance, right? Well here goes!

                I could give you the typical "I want to work for you because I want to get experience, learn from great people, etc." and make this all about me. And while yes, admittedly, those things are true, the biggest reason I want to intern at Basecamp is because I want to contribute to a business that is focused on the needs of others. The sole reason I put myself through two bootcamps (UX design + full stack development) isn't because I wanted to make a ton of money or to gain recognition, but to work with passionate people to help change the way people do things; to make products that will enrich the lives of others and make their day-to-day easier. And because of this, I have nothing to fear in expressing ideas, and taking constructive criticism like a champ.

                I want to be part of your collective "we".
                The way you describe your company, your diverse community of doers/thinkers/sharers/helpers/innovators that make Basecamp a reality, and the people you're helping, it's hard NOT to want to work there and at the end of every day be able to say "woo, we did some great work today!" You're fabulous human beings, trying to help other human beings. So why not hire an intern, me, who has the same mindset? I'm pretty good at giving a damn. And, if I'm being very honest, having the chance to be mentored by and work side-by-side with someone who loves his/her craft would be invaluable.

                I've worked on several personal projects, and I've plans for many more, especially collaborative ones.

                I have most of my personal projects up and running online, and the links for them can be found via my homepage: <a href="http://spilledmilk.github.io">http://spilledmilk.github.io</a>

                Design-wise, I worked with my UX mentor on designs for both web (fundraising site) and mobile (foodtruck app), going through the design process (no shortcuts) -- meaning I've done mock client interviews, wireframing, hi-fi mockups, prototyping, and several iterations of re-designs based on feedback.
                <br /><br />
                Programming experience? Yes. Incidentally, I initially learned to program in Ruby and create web-apps using Ruby on Rails (it made learning the MVC pattern easier, thanks Basecamp!). I'm now learning Javascript and trying to create a recipe collection app using RoR with ReactJS. But some of my earlier projects include a quotes app, a Yelp-like clone (still working on some features), and a Udemy-like app (still in progress).

                So, why should you hire me as one of your interns? Because passion is the driving force behind success, and I feel that's something we have in common. I don't know the meaning of giving up, I work hard and learn quickly, and I am an independent individual trying to find a group of amazing team members to do some good with. At the end of it all, I believe we will have mutually benefited each other -- that's the goal. And I believe what sets me apart from being a good versus great engineer-in-the-making is my hunger for knowledge and to better myself every day. Help me, help you!
